# Development Toolkit Design

Ruby based system for exposing ruby and js communication system.

Communication via JSON.

Ruby system can be backed by rails.
  Controllers configured similar to models
JS system backed by sereth scripts
  Utilize Templates
  Connect communication channels
  Provide contexts - May be partially stored on server as sessions
Template Manager
  Reat Templates consisting of HTML + JS
  May slim_assets into these

  !! Gets permissions from included scripts

Compile into /app/templates/... 
  /app/templates/manifest.rb = full manifest of the included templates, and metadata
  /app/templates/raw/namespaces*/name.format - Offer model bindings with file sync
  /app/templates/compiled/namespaces*/name.js
    Cache compiled templates
  Access through controller. Access may require validation through permission system.
    Permission system implemented through call API

  Compilation parses the templates in the raw directory, and generates the compiled + manifest

  For development the manifest does not long cache, but recompiles each change

Need separate task to compile templates, since not compiling into asset directory anymore

-- JS 
  access(args*) - Array of arguments saved for the access metadata container for use in the
    access callback event.


-- Config
  Cache size. Going over will expire entries and re-query them from disk.

-- Assumptions
  Root HTML loaded by browser (Including basic content)
  Initial system configures loaders, template managers, core callbacks, contexts
  Client configures the desired channels
    Channel notify of template path (B)
  Channels load data, and render template
    Reloads may trigger re-renders though the bound contexts

Views are in a path context
  Each view is a parent container of an instance of that view
  Instances of views are bound to instances of channels.

  View sub-contexts are down-links to other instances of other views. Super = up

  context type = view
  context data = generated by specific view. view-impl assoc to a generator
  context struct = utilized sub-components

  reusable components through up-assocs


Distribution: Ruby Gem

TemplateManager
  Parser fills Template
    Also calls pre-configured callouts based on raw handlers
  Manifest stores Template Metadata
  Template points to Raw + Cached + Meta/Callbacks





## Ruby
  Library Manager: Gem + Bundler
  Testing: RSpec

  Tool Support: Rails

  Sprocket engine for template generation

```ruby
# Parses the first javascript tag to extract stuff
coffee:
  initiate () ->
    ... # Run once when the template is loaded for the first time. Usually populates context
  around_render (args, render) ->
    ... # Run every time the template is rendered. Instantiates context. All args 
    return render(args) # Return the actual result of the render operation
    # The render operation generates HTML from the rest of the template
  before_render (args) ->
  after_render (dom) ->
```

## JS
  Library Manager: Bower?
  Testing: Jasmine Testing

# TODO
Multy-system queue to notify updates
